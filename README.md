# GeekcampSG Conference Playbook

This conference planning playbook is work-in-progress, aiming to guide the running of future Geekcamp conferences.

Highly inspired by @winston's [Conference Planning Playbook](https://github.com/winston/Conference_Planning_Playbook)

---

## Prelude
GeekcampSG has been around since 2009. Even though we are (probably) the oldest community conference in Singapore, one of the areas we are lacking is in the knowledge management of the SOPs and good practices for organising the conference. This has resulted in new organisers having to figure out things on their own, sometimes encountering avoidable blind spots due to their inexperience.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was a constraint which resulted in the conference being held online due to social distancing. GeekcampSG 2020 was not only a virtual conference, but one that experimented with live compositing in front of a green screen to retain a conference hall experience. In fact, we believe that we may be the first community conference in Singapore that used such a setup. Thus, we believe there are new learnings and knowledge worthwhile documenting.

We hope that this playbook can allow future organisers to build on the knowledge of their predecessors, and aid the longevity of GeekcampSG.

At the same time, we hope that this document can be a solid reference for any new conference organiser. It could be someone executing an inaugural run of a new conference, or those who want to bring their conference virtual first time.

We are always learning and welcome feedback/discussion with regards to this playbook. Finally, what we have presented has worked for our context, but may not necessarily work for other conferences. YMMV.

### Venues Management



### Speaker Management



### Emcee

#### Expectations

The emcees help transition between sections of the conference. They also engage the audience with additional insight and help facilitate the Q&A. They also provide time for the speaker to get ready. 

#### People

At any point in time, there must be an emcee, and there should be a backup emcee. It is highly recommended to rotate emcee roles each day or each half-day. 

#### Tasks

##### Pre-Conference

- Prepare speaker introduction
  - Correct pronunciation of speaker names
- Prepare talk introduction
- If necessary: Talk and speaker introduction slide to show the audience. Work with the designer.

Emcees should make preparations for themselves. Their own material can come in any form, like slides, notes or cards. [BYOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device). Verify that there is space to locate your laptop (or in some venues an additional screen). Their material should at minimum introduce the speaker (talk title, speaker name, speaker background). They can prepare extra material to engage their audience and fill in time gaps. Examples are:
- Fact bites about the event, venue or speaker
- Trivia questions

#### Conference Day 

- Start the day, welcome everyone & other misc briefings
- Handover to the Chairperson/Vice Chairperson for introductory talk
- `for talk in talks:`
  - Introduce speakers and their talks
  - Handover to the speakers
    - If they ask, assure them that they can be heard
    - Any technical issues, the emcee has to be prepared to step in and make decisions
  - Optional: Wrap up the speaker's talk
  - Do the Q&A
- On the last talk before breaks
  - Ask the time-keeper when to end the break
- Start of breaks
  - Sponsor messages & other misc notices
  - Announce the break and where they can mingle
- End the day

Emcees should also be responsible for announcing ad-hoc updates such as changes to the schedule or lost and found.

#### Resources

- Text-to-speech (like Google [Translate](https://translate.google.com/)) engines are decent references for pronunciation
