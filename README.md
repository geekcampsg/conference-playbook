### Marketing
The objective of the marketing team is to create awareness of GeekcampSG

Marketing team members need to manage and utilise social media and mailing lists to reach out to target segments. It is ok to be unfamiliar with the tools, but it is highly recommended that interested candidates should at least have some experience with using social media.

#### People
Assuming all templates are in place:
- Pre-conference: Min 1 pax. Ideally at least 2 pax
- Conference: Min 2 pax. Ideally at least 3 pax

Note: during D day. There is a lot of work to be done. The lesser people there are for marketing, the less capacity there is to execute the full marketing plan

#### Tasks

##### Access
- Give trusted members of the team access to the social media accounts

##### Notifications
- Setup email forwarding for new marketing team members
- Setup tweetdeck to monitor hashtags and mentions

##### Queries
- Ensure that queries sent via email and on social media are answered promptly

##### Prepare messaging templates for event phases
- Recruitment

- Sponsorship deck
- CFP + conference date
- CFP closing soon / CFP extension

- Collect speaker's social media handles
- Individual talk/speaker promotion
- Registration

### Emcee

#### Expectations

The emcees help transition between sections of the conference. They also engage the audience with additional insight and help facilitate the Q&A. They also provide time for the speaker to get ready. 

#### People

At any point in time, there must be an emcee, and there should be a backup emcee. It is highly recommended to rotate emcee roles each day or each half-day. 

#### Tasks

##### Pre-Conference

- Prepare speaker introduction
  - Correct pronunciation of speaker names
- Prepare talk introduction
- If necessary: Talk and speaker introduction slide to show the audience. Work with the designer.

Emcees should make preparations for themselves. Their own material can come in any form, like slides, notes or cards. [BYOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device). Verify that there is space to locate your laptop (or in some venues an additional screen). Their material should at minimum introduce the speaker (talk title, speaker name, speaker background). They can prepare extra material to engage their audience and fill in time gaps. Examples are:
- Fact bites about the event, venue or speaker
- Trivia questions

#### Conference Day 

- Start the day, welcome everyone & other misc briefings
- Handover to the Chairperson/Vice Chairperson for introductory talk
- `for talk in talks:`
  - Introduce speakers and their talks
  - Handover to the speakers
    - If they ask, assure them that they can be heard
    - Any technical issues, the emcee has to be prepared to step in and make decisions
  - Optional: Wrap up the speaker's talk
  - Do the Q&A
- On the last talk before breaks
  - Ask the time-keeper when to end the break
- Start of breaks
  - Sponsor messages & other misc notices
  - Announce the break and where they can mingle
- End the day

Emcees should also be responsible for announcing ad-hoc updates such as changes to the schedule or lost and found.

#### Resources

- Text-to-speech (like Google [Translate](https://translate.google.com/)) engines are decent references for pronunciation
